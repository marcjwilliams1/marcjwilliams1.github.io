I want to create a personal academic website. I want it to be very minimal in design. Here are some websites I like:
- https://talfanevans.co.uk/
- https://nat.org/ this one is probably too minimal because I at least want to have some tabs that people can click on but it gives you the idea

I want it to have the following features:
- landing page with some text saying Hi I'm Marc, I'm a computational biologist interested in cancer genomics.
- Page with publications, you can get the from here: https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yS47gHMAAAAJ&hl=en I only want the ones where I'm listed as first author, you'll need to follow the links in the google scholar page to find that out, or if that's difficult list them and I can help you. I'll want hyperlinks to all of the papers on the page (to the actual journal websites)
- Software page that links to my github https://github.com/marcjwilliams1, I might want to link to some specific software but that can wait
- links to my linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-williams-b40a92198/) twitter (https://x.com/marcjwills_) somewhere on the landing page
